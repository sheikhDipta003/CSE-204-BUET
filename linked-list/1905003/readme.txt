1. Main.java contains the interface List<E> with all the function headers given in Table-1. It also includes a sample main function in order to check implementations of both Arr.java and LL.java.

2. Arr.java and LL.java each contain a class, AList and LList respectively, implementing the interface in Main.java. An additional function named printArray() is included in the AList in order to print the list items. Similarly, another function named printLinkedList() is included in LList in order to print the list items.

3. Finally, TNL.java includes the main function for implementing TNL task with Table-2 as a sample input-output and it uses only the AList and LList classes, the only difference being the object declaration.
